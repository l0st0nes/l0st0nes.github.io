          The Legend of the Dragon

          <!--https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/article-chinese-dragons.htm-->
          It was said that thousands of years ago, Yandi (a legendary tribal
          leader) was born by his mother's telepathy with a mighty dragon. With
          the help of the dragon, and allied with Huangdi (a legendary tribal
          leader), they opened the prelude to Chinese civilization; so Yandi and
          Huangdi were considered to be ancestors of the Chinese people. As time
          has gone by, Chinese people refer to themselves as the descendants of
          Yandi and Huangdi, as well as the descendants of the Chinese dragon. A
          Spirit of 'Unrelenting and Pioneering' Dragon has transformed from an
          imaginary prodigy to a mascot from ancient times to the present. It
          represents the Chinese people's unrelenting and pioneering spirit of
          keeping pace with the times. Not only is the dragon prevailing in
          China, but it's also very popular among the Chinese people living
          overseas; it has become the symbol of China and of Chinese culture.
